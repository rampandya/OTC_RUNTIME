Testing Observations:

After running several test in each browser, I have noticed that the test case works the best in Google 
Chrome and Firefox.  

I have code to handle SurveyMonkey pop up.  At one point, it was coming up but I don't see this pop 
up anymore.  I have left the code if in the event it pops up.

To run test case in MS IE configure MS IE as follow:

1.  Include the path of the IE driver in the windows PATH variable.
2.  Under the view menu of IE the zoom must be set to 100%.
3.  For all zones in Tools->Security, Enable Protected Mode. 

Known issues with IE:

I have also noticed that sometime in IE browser in the middle of the test case,
it gets stuck.  At this point, you just need to terminate it manually. 

Occasionally, a message "InternetExplorer is not working" comes up after the successful completion of the test.  
At this point, you justneed to click on the close button.  It seems that there are some issues IE driver.  

Sometimes, The very first query test fails under IE browser for fuctional test.  All other query works fine.
