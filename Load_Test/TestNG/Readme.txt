This load test case is performed with the combination of 
Selenium and TestNG.  

This jar file and bat file are used to simulate the load test
for 10, 50 and 100 users.  The script is configured to run each
test sequentially.  First it simulates 10, 50 and then 100. 

Please refer to runotc_testng.bat file to see how to invoke the load test.
